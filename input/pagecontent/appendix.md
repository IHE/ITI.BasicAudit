In general, IHE Profiles should have "Security Considerations" sections in both Volume 1 and in Volume 2. In Volume 2, the Security Considerations section should have a definition of how the AuditEvent is filled out when the given transaction happens. This definition usually includes one specification of an AuditEvent to be created by each of the actors involved in the transaction.

All of the AuditEvent (AuditMessage) encodings can be found on [Gazelle AuditTrail section](https://gazelle.ihe.net/gss/audit-messages/list.seam;jsessionid=O8kPo08QmPxFgrWZQbhfzfTr). These specifications usually use a table format. These are in the format of DICOM AuditMessage, but the mapping to FHIR AuditEvent is defined in the [FHIR AuditEvent mapping to DICOM](http://hl7.org/fhir/auditevent-mappings.html#dicom).

The IHE ITI-18 transaction has prototyped the documentation change to use the gazelle method rather than using a table. See the (XDS) Registry Stored Query Transaction [2:3.18.5 Security Considerations](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-18.html#3.18.5).
