  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
This Implementation Guide includes the profile for basic audit of REST operations and application that would use these audit log resources. 
  </p>
	<a name="technical"> </a>
	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
    	<p>
For any FHIR REST operation there is a well-defined AuditEvent specified in this implementation guide. The appropriate AuditEvent shall be recorded by Client and Server applications that claim conformance to this implementation guide. The resulting set of AuditEvents are made available to a client authorized to retrieve them.

	<h3>Open Questions</h3>
	<p>
       <p>Is there an established way to record an OAuth token that I could define? I am expecting that mostly a unique identifier of the token is minimally needed. With a username and purposeOfUse being useful. I need some guidance and samples.</p>
	   <p>Is there any alternatives to the patterns I have defined? I did note some alternatives with recommendations in narrative?</p>
	   <p>Is there some other improvements one could recommend?</p>
	   <p>note in my pattern for Query, I allow the non-base64Binary query string to be put into entity.name. Is this useful?</p>
	   <p>I need some examples of how Query is recorded for variations on search. Such as a POST with a Parameters?</p>
	   <p>I wish there was a flag similar but opposite to MustSupport, something like ShouldNotUse to discourage use while not making it invalid to use.</p>
