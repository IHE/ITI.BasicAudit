# Open Issues

- [BasicAudit/1](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/40). This IG is more an abstract pattern setting than it is an implementable and conformance. Not clear how conformance to this IG will be declared in a way that is understandable at the IHE Integration Statement. Do we need named options for each defined pattern? Are the current "ANY Secure Client" and "ANY Secure Server" sufficient?     
- [BasicAudit/2](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/41). Is the oAuth AuditEvent patterns appropriate, especially the opaque one. With Opaque is the last 32 characters biggenough yet not too big?
- [BasicAudit/3](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/42). The R4 version of AuditEvent uses extensible binding often, this has limited the ways that the AuditEvent can be constrained. R5 has relaxed these to either example or preferred binding, so some further can be done in this IG once R5 is released.
- [BasicAudit/4](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/43). The audit examples are brought in from MHD, PIXm, and PDQm; and "adjusted" to fit the RESTful pattern. This adjustment is not necessary, but follows with the proposal that these RESTful patterns are used as patterns in other Implementation Guides. Thus, these need to be evaluated as to if the adjustment is useful, or not. There should be no reason to update MHD, PIXm, or PDQm if there is not benefit, but there should also be no problem updating them. The adjustment here was more as an exercise in determining if the pattern concept could work, and not an excercise in forcing a change.
  - The adjustment was to the .type and .subtype, and one profile was changed from import/create to read.
- [BasicAudit/5](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/44). RESTful profiles start with a non-patient specific one, then a derived one with the patient slice. Is this the cleanest?
- [BasicAudit/6](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/45). This IG covers only basic RESTful http. Not covered are FHIR Operations, or advanced http activities like Patch, conditional create, conditional update, etc? What others are needed, for them please provide an example transaction that can be used in a profiled example.
- [BasicAudit/7](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/46). X-Request-Id header -- I explained this only inside of the RESTful section, but it is applicable anywhere that X-Request-Id is used. X-Reqeust-Id is profiled differently than the example given in the FHIR core specification. Specifically there is a entity type defined here to enable slicing, where the example in FHIR core uses both type (job) and role (stream) which is harder to slice. I did not make this a standalone section because it is simply too small.  
  - X-Request-Id vs TraceId -- I added X-Request-Id profiling. I did not add TraceId, as I am not as aware of what this is. It seems very similar, unclear if it is different or the same thing. The modeling of TraceId that is in the FHIR Core is a bit different than I modeled X-Request-Id here. TraceId example in core is a .entity.type #21 "Job", with a .entity.what.identifier.type #TraceId. Where as for X-Request-Id I followed the example that Grahame indicted his server supports today for X-Request-Id. I welcome comment, as I am not an expert TraceId nor X-Reqeust-Id. 
- [BasicAudit/8](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/47). who.identifier and what.identifer, rather than the .reference, are used because it is expected that as audit logging is happening these values are directly available, and the resource reference is not known. However it is possible that the resource reference is known, should we add a MS on who.reference and what.reference to encourage recording of these "when they are known"?
- [BasicAudit/9](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/48). put homeCommunityId in as an Agent. Given that the definition in XUA is standalone, and is independent of organization or user. 
- [BasicAudit/16](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/53). In an AuditEvent that is describing a network interaction, should response time be recorded in the .period element? Who would be responsible for recording this response time? This seems too undefinable in abstract actor terms. Thus should it be given as guidance without constraints or requirements?
- [BasicAudit/17](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/54). Should a minimally populated or maximum populated AuditEvent have a defined .meta.security code so as to be more able to be access controlled at the Audit Consumer API?
- [BasicAudit/18](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/55). Is the use of AssuranceLevel proper? Should the extension element be defined more specific to NIST-800-63 assurance levels, and not allow to be carrying historical vocabulary that is not specifically assurance-level but rather the method of authentication used (e.g. urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:PasswordProtectedTransport)?
- [BasicAudit/19](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/56). Note: Support for [HL7 Security for Scalable Registration, Authentication, and Authorization (aka UDAP) ](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/udap-security/history.html) when it gets published  
- [BasicAudit/21](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.BasicAudit/issues/37) IG builder / validation issue with the slicing I need to use in AuditEvent.
